                        Lorem <strong>Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
                         Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the <em>1500s</em>,
                            when an unknown printer took a galley of type 
                         and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
                        “Poderíamos ter sido fortes... Unidos como um povo só...”
                        It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
                         remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
                          sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
                           software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
                           Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.
                            It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, 
                            making it over 2000 years old.
